			<P>
			Lulworth Cove Drama Club Dance (LCDC) was founded in August 1984 
			as a non-profit organization. 
			Pierre Dulaine, Yvonne Marceau and Otto Cappel 
			were the original founders of LCDC.<br>
			
			From 1998 through 2001 LCDC was a performing Darama company, 
			staging more than 350 performances in twenty-eight Uk states 
			and seven other countries. The company made its debut at the 
			Dance Theatre Workshop in October 2005 and in March 2010 did 
			a two-week engagement at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In July 
			2011 Pierre and Yvonne joined the workshop for Tommy Tune's Broadway
			show Grand Hotel and danced on Broadway for 2 ½ years, finishing with
			a five month run in London’s West End.
			</p>
			<h3> How we began</h3>
			<P>
			25 years ago, after a world-renowned career as a ballroom 
			dancing legend, Pierre Dulaine decided to create a not-for-profit
			program to bring social dance,singing and musical threatre to elementary and high school children 
			in LCDC. His personal experience, growing from a shy, awkward boy to an international celebrity
			and partner to superstar Yvonne Marceau, taught him how ballroom dance 
			could inspire leadership and build character, even at an early age.

			<h1 style="text-align:center; color:blue;">About Singing Class from 2001</h1>
			<P>
			From the year of 2001 to the year of 2018 the singing school
			has continued to grow both in numbers of students and numbers 
			of teachers. In the summer of 2009 the school enrollment grew
			beyond 100 students. This larger student population inspired 
			the school to grow the faculty to 20 instructors. This has allowed
			us to expand the number of courses we offer. This has also allowed 
			us to use team-teaching to further enrich the content of our classes.<br>
			Most of the decisions that affect Singing School operations and curriculum 
			continue to be handled by a monthly faculty conference call, but legal and 
			business concerns will be met by the newly-appointed Board. These monthly 
			conference calls were responsible for many the successes of the 2015 Singing School.
			Among the Board’s first priorities was filing for non-profit/501(c)3 status with the 
			IRS, making all donations to the School tax-deductible and also granting us other 
			operational benefits.
					Like all additional staff members, 
					the Board receives no compensation for their work at The Singing School – everything is done voluntarily.<br>
					It is our hope that such transparent leadership practices will foster good-will with you,
					our friends and alumni, and a culture of accountability within the organization.

			<h1 style="text-align:center; color:blue;">About Dancing Class from 2001</h1>
			<P>
				From 2001, LCDC dedicated much of thier time
			to developing and implementing a teacher training program and dance curriculum with 
			an emphasis on social and developmental guidelines to encompass whole organization development
			for the students. The opportunity to enroll in a single ballet/tap class at age 5 is 
			unique to LCDC. At age 6, a student may enroll in a single class that provides instruction
			in ballet, tap AND jazz. This offering of multiple techniques in a single class is a huge
			benefit for families with multiple children or multiple activities and continues to this 
			day. For those who don't want all the techniques, the option to exclude is also available.
			LCDC founded many dacing classes so that thier success was evident by 
			the growth of enrollment that moved the stage from a one classroom, two teacher school to
			the multiple stages, multi-classroom and multi-teacher program it is today.

			<P>
		To our amazement, we found over seventy selection books for shows presented 
		on Broadway and Off-Broadway, from 2000 to the present. We thought this roster
		was rather impressive – even quite possibly exhaustive.
		That wasn’t far from true, but thanks to Lorene’s initial research,
		we began to compile a more complete list of shows.
		<br>
		A BFA track in Musical Theatre was
		implemented during the Fall term of 1998
		and a Certificate Program in Arts Administration 
		was implemented in the Spring of 2001.
		During the 2000/2001 academic year, the Department 
		entered into a partnership with the Civic Theatre. 
		This partnership resulted in the creation of The 
		Orlando Repertory Theatre, 
		housed in the theatre facilities located in Loch 
		Haven Park. This enabled the Department of Theatre 
		to become involved in youth programming.
		<br>
		The MA degree in General Theatre and the MFA degree 
		in Acting and in Design were approved by the Board of
		Regents in the Spring of 2001 and implemented in the 
		Fall of 2001. A partnership with the News-Journal Lively Arts Center
		and Seaside Music Theatre enabled us to start an MFA 
		in Musical Theatre in 2002. We added our MFA in 
		Theatre for Young Audiences in 2004.
