			progressing in skill and technical ability at each grade</li>

			<h1>
				Class Tuition Rates and School Fees
			</h1>
		<P>
		All costs for participating in our annual school performances are included in your tuition,
		including costumes and rehearsals.  Taxes are also included in the listed rates unless otherwise noted.
		</p>
			<h1>
				Details
			</h1>
		<P>
		Tuition is calculated on a weekly basis rather than an annual one,
		ensuring that families only pay for actual class time, and never 
		for holiday closures.  While this removes
		the convenience of equal monthly payments, it provides a more 
		accurate and fair tuition for every family through the year.
		</p>
		<p>
		Students enrolled on Mondays have fewer classes in 
		the year and so pay a lower tuition.  Months with 
		holiday closures are charged only for the weeks with classes.
		Students are not charged tuition during Nutcracker
		Production Week unless their class is in session.
		</p>
		<p>
		<h5>The following exceptions apply:</h5>
		Our Pre-Professional Academy has a fixed monthly 
		fee which covers all of the Academy classes from 
		1pm-3:30pm, as well as unlimited ballet, contemporary,
		tap and modern-jazz classes 
		outside of the Academy class hours.  All costume, 
		choreography and rehearsal costs are included in the PPA monthly fee.
